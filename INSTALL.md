## CONTRACTS DEPLOYMENT

Deployment of contracts may be done either manually or via an automated pipeline.

For manual deployment, configure the constants in `./deploy/constants/*.js` for the specific network (for example, add a `chainID: your_parameter,` line to each file as needed).

For automatic deployment, we use `make` and Makefiles. The Makefile manages the deployment and configuration of various smart contracts and helpers, including targets for installing dependencies, deploying contracts, and managing environment variables.

## QUICK START

1. Run `make env-example` â†’ creates `.env.example`
2. Move `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
3. Run `make install`
4. **Optional only for local Hardhat node**: Run `NODE_RPC=[PUT_HERE_THE_RPC_URL_FOR_FORKING] make launch-hh-node`
5. Run `make deploy-all`

## OVERVIEW

The deployment process includes the following steps:
1. Define environment parameters in `.env`. Run `make env-example` in the terminal to generate an example configuration file `.env.example`. Rename this file to `.env` and set the correct values.
2. To install dependencies, run `make install`.
3. To deploy to a local node (for example, a Hardhat node), use the command `NODE_RPC=[PUT_HERE_THE_RPC_URL_FOR_FORKING] make launch-hh-node`. This will launch a local Hardhat node on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, forked from the latest block of the network defined in `NODE_RPC`, with chainId 31337. These deployments use create3 deployer and it should be predeployed in original network or deploy it.
4. To deploy to a remote node, replace `[PUT_NETWORK_NAME_HERE]` with the correct UPPERCASE network name in `.env` and provide the correct values for the variables.
5. To deploy all contracts, use `make deploy-all`. It will automatically read the configuration from `.env` and deploy all contracts step by step. If any deployment fails, check the configuration and restart the process by running this command again. Check `Issues` section below for clarification.
6. To deploy a single contract, you can use the following commands:
    - `make deploy-helpers` deploys all helper contracts defined in `OPS_HELPER_NAMES` (pipe-separated list),
    - `make deploy-leftover-exchanger` deploys LeftoverExchanger,
    - `make deploy-fee-collector-factory` deploys FeeCollector and FeeCollectorFactory,
    - `make deploy-new-fee-collector` deploys specific FeeCollectors defined in `OPS_FEE_COLLECTOR_OPERATORS` and `OPS_FEE_COLLECTOR_OPERATORS_TARGETS`,
    - `make upgrade-fee-collector` upgrades the FeeCollector implementation.


## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

- OPS_NETWORK: The name of the network to deploy to (e.g., localhost).
- OPS_CHAIN_ID: The chain ID of the network.

## ISSUES

- In case when the pipeline was broken and you are going to launch single target deployment first of all set all deployments skipable by calling `make deploy-skip-all`.
- Be careful with using `make clean` - it's remove all deployments in `./deployments/($OPS_NETWORK)`

## TODO 

- logging
- error handling
